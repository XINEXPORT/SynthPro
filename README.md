SynthPro aka SynthMage

A fictional ecommerce musical store 
where users can create hypothetical synthesiszers and musical instruments
</br>
</br>
Some ideas for this site is to use popular AI APIs to help generate images of fake synthesizers</br>
Based on a social media post of a friend of mine, ill leverage Generative AI to make improbable synthesizers based on a user's input </br>
itll have all the workings of a tyical ecommerce site, except the monetary transaction
